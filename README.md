# Hi there, I'm Pranay 👋

**Builder | Technical DevRel | ZK Privacy Advocate**

I am a full-stack Web3 developer and technical community specialist. I spend my time bridging the gap between complex cryptographic architectures (like ZK proofs) and the frontend product engineers who build on them. 

Currently, I'm shipping mini-apps on **Base** and **Farcaster** while exploring client-side proving paradigms and edge execution architectures.

### 🚀 What I'm up to:
- 🏗️ **Building:** **Post2X** - A Base mini-app (Next.js/TS) for cross-posting to X and Farcaster using Privy & Frames.
- 🗣️ **Educating:** Acted as a Community Ambassador for **Aleo**, hosting in-person ZK meetups and driving testnet adoption (Recognized as a Top-Tier Contributor w/ ~$14k grant).
- 🌱 **Currently Exploring:** Client-side STARK proving, the Actor execution model, and bridging Rust-centric VMs to TypeScript environments. *(Note: This is a subtle, perfect nod to Miden's tech stack).*

### 💻 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Next.js (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Prisma, PostgreSQL
- **Web3:** Farcaster Frames, Base (L2), Wagmi/Viem, ZK Privacy Tech
- **Community:** Technical documentation, developer onboarding, workshop hosting

### 📈 Proof of Work
- 🏆 **Aleo Tier-1 Contributor:** Drove massive early-stage community adoption and developer education for the Aleo privacy network.
- 📱 **Base Mini-Apps:** Architecting consumer-friendly UX on modern crypto rails.
